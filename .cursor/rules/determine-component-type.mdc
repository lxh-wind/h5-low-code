ðŸ§  Before generating a component, please decide:

## Will this component be a Server Component or a Client Component?

### Server Component âœ… (default):
- Use if:
  - You donâ€™t need interactivity (no `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
  - The component uses server-only data fetching (`fetch()`, DB queries)
  - You want maximum performance and smaller JS bundle

### Client Component ðŸ”„:
- Use if:
  - You need state, effects, or event handlers
  - You use browser-only APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, etc.)
  - You use third-party libraries that require the DOM

ðŸ‘‰ Type one of the following:
- `server` â€“ to create a Server Component (no `"use client"` directive)
- `client` â€“ to create a Client Component (adds `"use client"` at the top)
